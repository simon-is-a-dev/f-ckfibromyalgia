                <p class="lead-text">It's not just "in your head". It's <span class="text-bad">real</span>, it's <span
                        class="text-bad">painful</span>, and it's time we talked about it properly.</p>

                        <p>Fibromyalgia is better described as a "central sensitivity syndrome". It's a long-term
                            condition that causes <span class="text-bad">pain all over the body</span>. But it's more
                            than just pain.</p>
                    </div>

                        <h3 style="font-size: 1.2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #ff0000;">Reality</h3>
                        <p>It's the brain amplifying pain signals. It's waking up <span class="text-bad">tired</span>
                            after 10 hours of sleep. It's the "fibro fog" that makes simple thoughts slip away like
                            smoke.</p>

                <div class="story-content">
                    <p><strong>"It's all in your head"</strong></p>
                    <p>Imagine waking up at 3 in the morning in <span class="text-bad">agony</span>. You try to muster
                        the strength to scream for help but the pain has you paralyzed.</p>
                    <p>You go see a doctor and all you get is: "It's your weight", "Could just be period pain", or
                        "maybe you're just stressed, try exercising more, eat healthier, stay active, drop the weight,
                        you will see it will sort itself out"...</p>
                    <p>Now imagine you try everything, exerting all your energy, and the symptoms just get worse. You go
                        back to the doctor and they don't listen. "Maybe this, maybe that, could be this" they go, but
                        they don't listen. Tests after tests, <span class="text-bad">nothing</span>.</p>
                    <p><strong>MORE MEDS</strong>, less meds, no meds... Nothing works and now you find yourself rushing
                        to the hospital because you are in so much pain you are struggling to breathe.</p>
                    <p>The doctors finally start trying. Specialist after specialist they try and try but nothing works.
                        And then finally... you have <strong>Fibromyalgia</strong>...</p>
                    <p>No known cure or treatment, pseudo effect meds. Ahh, the <em>Silent Condition</em> as it's known.
                    </p>
                    <p>This is the reality my girlfriend had to go through and is still going through. A condition with
                        <span class="text-bad">no metrics</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>This is why I started the <strong>Fibromyalgia Project</strong>: to give those without metrics a
                        voice and a fighting chance. Making pain visible as to say <span class="text-red"><strong>F*CK
                                YOU FIBROMYALGIA</strong></span>, you will not remain silent.</p>

                <h2>The Goal</h2>
                <div class="story-content">
                    <p class="lead-text"><strong>Pain is invisible.</strong> That’s what makes it so isolating.</p>
                    <p>Fibromyalgia doesn’t always leave visible scars, casts, or bandages. It lives beneath the
                        surface—quiet, persistent, misunderstood. Too many people carry that weight alone, wondering if
                        anyone truly sees what they’re fighting every single day.</p>

                    <p>The mission is simple: <span class="text-bad">Make pain visible.</span></p>

                    <p>The <strong>Fibromyalgia Project</strong> exists to shine a light into that quiet struggle. To
                        turn statistics into stories. To turn isolation into community. To replace silence with
                        understanding. This is about building a place where people can find hope when they’re exhausted,
                        clarity when they’re confused, and strength when they feel like they have none left.</p>

                    <p><strong>What comes next?</strong></p>
                    <p>Connecting with researchers, clinicians, and industry experts to ground the movement in real
                        data. Showing the numbers. Showing the science. Showing the lived reality. Because when we
                        combine evidence with experience, something powerful happens: people start listening.</p>

                    <p>Fibromyalgia is frightening when you feel like you’re navigating it alone. But it doesn’t have to
                        be a solitary battle.</p>
                    <p>One entry. One shared story. One log at a time.</p>

                    <p>We fight for visibility.<br>
                        We fight for dignity.<br>
                        We fight so that people living with fibromyalgia don’t just survive... <span
                            class="text-red">THEY LIVE!</span></p>

                    <p><strong>And that changes everything.</strong></p>

                    <p>Pain comes in waves. Fatigue crashes over you. But when you recount it to a doctor weeks later,
                        it's just a blur. "How would you rate your pain 3 weeks ago on a Tuesday?"... <span
                            class="text-bad">I don't f*cking know.</span></p>
                    <p>I built <strong>Frogsy</strong> to change that.</p>
                    <p>It's not about "tracking" for the sake of data. It's about <span class="text-bad"><strong>HARD
                                EVIDENCE</strong></span>. It's built for <span class="text-red">privacy</span> first. No

                    <p>Designed to be used in <strong>seconds</strong>, even when your hands hurt and your brain is
                        foggy. Tap. Track. Done.</p>
                    <p>It turns the <span class="text-bad">chaos</span> of our symptoms into clear, undeniable patterns
                        so you can walk into that doctor's office and say: <em>"Here is the proof."</em></p>
                    <p>And eventually? We use that <span class="text-red">raw, anonymous data</span> to force the
                        medical community to listen. To show them the scale of our pain in numbers they cannot ignore.
                    </p>
                    <p>Together we can say <b class="text-red">F*CK FIBROMYALGIA</b></p>

                    <p class="lead-text">This project has a heartbeat. And it’s hers.</p>

                    <p>The <strong>Fibromyalgia Project</strong> is dedicated to the woman who lives this fight
                        every
                        day — my girlfriend. I have watched her stand up to pain that most people will never
                        understand.
                        I have seen strength that doesn’t look loud or dramatic, but steady, relentless,
                        unbreakable.
                    </p>
                    <p>Fibromyalgia tries to steal energy, certainty, and peace. It tests patience. It tests
                        identity.
                        It tests hope. And still, she keeps going.</p>
                    <p>Her courage has changed me. It has taught me that resilience is not about pretending
                        something
                        doesn’t hurt. It’s about choosing to move forward even when it does. That lesson is
                        something I
                        will carry for the rest of my life.</p>

                    <p><strong>Keep fighting.<br>
                            Keep trying.<br>
                            <span class="text-red">Never give up.</span></strong></p>

                    <p>There is light at the end of this tunnel. Science is moving. Awareness is growing. Voices are
                        getting louder. And together, we will find the way through.</p>
                    <p>This is not just a project. It is a promise.</p>

                    <p class="text-red" style="font-family: var(--font-display); font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 30px;">I
                        love you. Always. And forever.</p>
