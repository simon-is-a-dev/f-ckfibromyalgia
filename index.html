                <p class="lead-text">It's not just "in your head". It's <span class="text-bad">real</span>, it's <span
                        class="text-bad">painful</span>, and it's time we talked about it properly.</p>

                        <p>Fibromyalgia is better described as a "central sensitivity syndrome". It's a long-term
                            condition that causes <span class="text-bad">pain all over the body</span>. But it's more
                            than just pain.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3 style="font-size: 1.2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #ff0000;">Reality</h3>
                        <p>It's the brain amplifying pain signals. It's waking up <span class="text-bad">tired</span>
                            after 10 hours of sleep. It's the "fibro fog" that makes simple thoughts slip away like
                            smoke.</p>

                <h2>The Story</h2>
                <div class="story-content">
                    <p><strong>"It's all in your head"</strong></p>
                    <p>Imagine waking up at 3 in the morning in <span class="text-bad">agony</span>. You try to muster
                        the strength to scream for help but the pain has you paralyzed.</p>
                    <p>You go see a doctor and all you get is: "It's your weight", "Could just be period pain", or
                        "maybe you're just stressed, try exercising more, eat healthier, stay active, drop the weight,
                        you will see it will sort itself out"...</p>
                    <p>Now imagine you try everything, exerting all your energy, and the symptoms just get worse. You go
                        back to the doctor and they don't listen. "Maybe this, maybe that, could be this" they go, but
                        they don't listen. Tests after tests, <span class="text-bad">nothing</span>.</p>
                    <p><strong>MORE MEDS</strong>, less meds, no meds... Nothing works and now you find yourself rushing
                        to the hospital because you are in so much pain you are struggling to breathe.</p>
                    <p>The doctors finally start trying. Specialist after specialist they try and try but nothing works.
                        And then finally... you have <strong>Fibromyalgia</strong>...</p>
                    <p>No known cure or treatment, pseudo effect meds. Ahh, the <em>Silent Condition</em> as it's known.
                    </p>
                    <p>This is the reality my girlfriend had to go through and is still going through. A condition with
                        <span class="text-bad">no metrics</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>This is why I started the <strong>Fibromyalgia Project</strong>: to give those without metrics a
                        voice and a fighting chance. Making pain visible as to say <span class="text-red"><strong>F*CK
                                YOU FIBROMYALGIA</strong></span>, you will not remain silent.</p>

            <div class="container">
                <h2>Frogsy</h2>
                <div class="story-content">
                    <p><strong>I needed to see the invisible.</strong></p>
                    <p>Pain comes in waves. Fatigue crashes over you. But when you recount it to a doctor weeks later,
                        it's just a blur. "How would you rate your pain 3 weeks ago on a Tuesday?"... <span
                            class="text-bad">I don't f*cking know.</span></p>
                    <p>I built <strong>Frogsy</strong> to change that.</p>
                    <p>It's not about "tracking" for the sake of data. It's about <span class="text-bad"><strong>HARD
                                EVIDENCE</strong></span>. It's built for <span class="text-red">privacy</span> first. No
                        selling your data. No ads. Just tools.</p>
                    <p>Designed to be used in <strong>seconds</strong>, even when your hands hurt and your brain is
                        foggy. Tap. Track. Done.</p>
                    <p>It turns the <span class="text-bad">chaos</span> of our symptoms into clear, undeniable patterns
                        so you can walk into that doctor's office and say: <em>"Here is the proof."</em></p>
                    <p>And eventually? We use that <span class="text-red">raw, anonymous data</span> to force the
                        medical community to listen. To show them the scale of our pain in numbers they cannot ignore.
                    </p>
                    <p>So that no one else has to go through what my girlfriend had to go through. So that no one else
                        has to hear "It's all in your head".</p>
                    <p>Together we can say <b class="text-red">F*CK FIBROMYALGIA</b></p>
